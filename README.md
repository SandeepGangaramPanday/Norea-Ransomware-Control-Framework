Norea Ransomware Control Framework

After seeing one too many news reports in the Netherlands and internationally on ransomware attacks, we felt compelled to create a control framework that could help protect organizations against this increasingly dire cyber threat. We were motivated not just by concern for the massive devastation that ransomware has the potential to cause, but the reality that no such control framework yet existed. The framework we developed selects the most relevant controls organizations can take to boost their defenses against ransomware and responses to an attack. Its goal is to help organizations protect themselves, their customers or end users, and ultimately society as a whole. As we learned from our research, the complexity of ransomware attacks is growing drastically within very short timespans. Meanwhile, our hope for a safer digital world has gained even more urgency as the past few years have shown that vital organizations, including even hospitals and utility service providers, also face a rise in ransomware attacks. 

To contextualize the technological and social climates in which ransomware has taken hold, to share insights and guidance from interviews we held with IT experts, and to explain why we chose particular controls, we decided to present our framework via this white paper. For readers seeking present-day and background information about ransomware, it may be useful to read the paper in full. For those eager to start applying the controls, focusing on the framework itself and the contents of chapter 3 will suffice. 

The NOREA ransomware framework is published as an open source tool because we want to keep improving the selection and application of controls. Writing this in early 2023, we want to enable the framework to evolve with the same efficiency and sophistication that weâ€™re observing of waves of ransomware attacks. We therefore invite interaction and feedback from interested parties or individuals, particularly those from the vital industries, as we all aim to keep ransomware in control.
